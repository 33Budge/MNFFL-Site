CURRENTLY ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH NFL SLEEPER LEAGUES





known needed fixes:
    -fixup the main.js file with the years and years codes situation\
    -find the correct way to do the right franchises and stuff (the roster_id meathod is bad for poritibility)
    -maybe add in the final readme that leagues that change league size may be messy
    -add past names, in the users fetch part
    -due to things like matchups using roster_id to id differnt people, maybe add in a variable that tracks which name is associated with that id number per year, like if someone changes roster_id's for some reason......
