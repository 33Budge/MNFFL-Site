      <h4>Rules, Regulations, and Processes</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tanking:</strong>  Deliberately losing games, not trying, etc. is not tolerated. Those who do will be sacked. You MUST start an entire lineup, any empty holes or players that clearly aren't going to get snaps will result in forfeiting your chance at any prize money or trophy and you will not be invited back the next year. (You will get a warning on the first occurrence.) (There are exceptions to this rule such as being gone on vacation, or other cases where you don't have time/ability to submit a lineup.)</li>
        <br> <li> <strong>Lineup Submitting:</strong> You are responsible for setting your lineup each week. (Noah, Rich) The only exception for this is if you are unable to do so because of an event, commitment, etc. that prevents you from having access to Sleeper. In this case you can have your Co-Manager submit the lineup for you or if you do not have a Co-Manager, hand your lineup in to the Commissioner. Example: Amon-Ra St. Brown is Questionable all week with an injury and you are going out of town to a place with no cell service. You would leave Amon-Ra in your starting lineup and turn in your alternate players to the Commissioner. If Amon-Ra ends up having to sit out, the Commissioner will play your alternate (EVEN IF THE ALTERNATE IS ALSO HURT. So pick your alternates carefully). You are allowed two alternates in this case and you inform the Commissioner of the order in which you prefer.</li>
        <br><li><strong>Entry Fee:</strong> This league costs $100 to enter. This is to encourage engagement through the entire season. Entry Fees are due by the start of the draft. This rule has been bent in the past, but I am going to start cracking down on it this year. No paying in the middle of Week 3 (Kedrick) CashApp: $ExpoUS | Venmo: ExpoUS</li>
        <br><li><strong>Prize Pool:</strong> 1st Place will receive $1000 and the MNFFL Traveling Trophy and 2nd place will receive $200. This is directly pulled from the $1200 worth of entry fees.</li>
        <br><li><strong>FAAB Waivers:</strong> Each team will start the year with $100 of FAAB cash (fake money) that you use to “bet” on waiver players. (Yes Brandon, this money is spendable) This is explained in the waivers section. If you run out of cash before the end of the year, you will have to bet $0 on each of your next waiver claims.</li>
        <br><li><strong>½ PPR:</strong> The league format. Each reception is worth 0.5 pts</li>
      </ul>

      <hr>

      <h4>Trade Rules</h4>
      <p>There will be no “teaming” or trading all of your good players to someone to make a super team. This will be considered Tanking and those involved will be sacked. (Note: Please respect the knowledge of new players and try not to intentionally rip them off. At the same time, new player please ask more experienced players for help if you don't know trade value)</p>

      <hr>

      <h4>Shit Talking</h4>
      <p>Highly Encouraged! There is a lot of banter in this league and smack that goes around every year. Have fun with it, don't get butt hurt, and keep race, gender, personal, etc. out of it.</p>

      <hr>

      <h4>Kickers</h4>
      <p>They are still gone, besides Tucker is a rapist anyways, get over it Connor. </p>

      <hr>

      <h4>Playoffs</h4>
      <p>
        7 of the 12 teams in the league will make the playoffs starting in Week 15. The #1 Seed will have a first round BYE. The Playoffs are determined by record followed by Points For (Total Points scored in the season) to break ties. Each playoff game lasts one week and are Single elimination. After Week 14, Teams that didn't make the playoffs are NOT allowed to make transactions.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4>Draft</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Date: </strong>Every year the Draft is held on Labor Day (First Monday in September) at 7:00PM CT. Please be on time and have your entry fee paid (Max, Kedrick, and Hailey)</li>
        <br><li><strong>Format:</strong> The draft is 15 rounds with 2 minutes to make each selection. The Draft is in snake format meaning every other round the order is reversed from the previous one. Draft Pick trading is on the entire offseason and IN the Draft. If you would like to attempt to make a draft pick trade while the Draft is taking place, please let me (Jack) know and I can pause the draft to allow time to make the trade. (Please do not abuse this just to get extra time, its scummy)</li>
        <br><li><strong>Order:</strong> The order is completely randomized every offseason no matter your finishing position from the previous year.</li>
        <br><li><strong>Note:</strong> Do not draft Lamar Jackson. I will find you, and I will kill you. (Connor)</li>
        <br><li><strong>P.S.:</strong> You can’t draft Justin Tucker OR Defenses this year Connor. Get wrecked… Also hes a rapist anyways </li>
      </ul>
